SELECT 
  'Car Model Name',  -- Replace with actual car model
  'brand-car-model', -- Replace with URL-friendly slug
  id,                -- This selects the brand_id automatically
  1500,              -- Daily price in INR
  'Automatic',       -- Transmission type
  'Petrol',          -- Fuel type
  5,                 -- Number of seats
  2,                 -- Luggage capacity
  'Detailed description of the car...',
  ARRAY['Feature 1', 'Feature 2', 'Feature 3'],
  'https://example.com/main-image.jpg',
  ARRAY['https://example.com/image1.jpg', 'https://example.com/image2.jpg']
FROM brands 
WHERE name = 'Brand Name'  -- Replace with actual brand name
```

### Adding a New Brand

If the car brand doesn't exist yet:

VALUES ('New Brand Name', 'https://example.com/logo.png');
```

2. Then proceed with adding the car as shown above

## Best Practices for Images

1. **Image Optimization**:
   - Resize car images to approximately 800×600 pixels
   - Compress images to reduce file size (use tools like TinyPNG)
   - Use JPG format for photographs

2. **Image Hosting**:
   - Host images on a reliable service (e.g., AWS S3, Cloudinary)
   - Ensure the hosting service provides fast delivery

3. **Image Naming**:
   - Use descriptive names for images (e.g., "honda-city-front-view.jpg")
   - Avoid spaces in filenames (use hyphens instead)

## Content Guidelines

### Car Descriptions

- Keep descriptions between 100-150 words
- Highlight key features and benefits
- Mention ideal use cases (e.g., "perfect for families", "ideal for beach trips")
- Include specific details about the car model

### Blog Posts

- Use Markdown formatting for all blog content
- Include at least one image per blog post
- Organize content with headings and subheadings
- Target 800-1500 words for blog posts
- Include relevant keywords naturally
- Add internal links to car rental pages where appropriate
